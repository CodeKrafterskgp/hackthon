                    <p>Our aim is to develop a Smart Classroom Management Systemâ€”a website that revolutionizes classroom dynamics by consolidating functionalities such as note-taking, attendance monitoring, and AI-powered instant doubt resolution tools. The platform seeks to streamline administrative tasks for educators and foster a more interactive and engaging learning environment for students.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Through innovative features and intuitive interface design, our solution aims to enhance classroom management practices. It also aims to boost student participation and enrich the overall educational experience.</p>
